According to Thomson, \"The surviving portions of the palace scattered between the Tuileries gardens, the courtyards of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts [Paris] and the Ch\u00e2teau de la Punta in ", "Corsica", " show that the columns, pilasters, dormers and tabernacles of the Tuileries were the outstanding masterpieces of non-figurative French Renaissance architectural sculpture\".", "[56]", "\n", "De l'Orme's original plans have not survived. ", "Jacques Androuet du Cerceau", ", however, has left us a set of plans for the Tuileries. One engraving shows a grandiose palace, with three courts and two oval halls.

Architectural historian David Thomson suggests that the oval halls within du Cerceau's courtyards were Catherine de' Medici's idea. She may have planned to use them for her famously lavish balls and entertainments.", "[58]", " Du Cerceau's drawings reveal that, before he published them in 1576, Catherine decided to join the Louvre to the Tuileries by a gallery running west along the north bank of the Seine. Only the ground floor of the first section, the ", "Petite Galerie", ", was completed in her lifetime.", "[59]", " It was left to ", "Henry IV", ", who ruled from 1589 to 1610, to add the second floor and the ", "Grande Galerie", " that finally linked the two palaces.", "[60]", "\n", "After de l'Orme died in 1570, Catherine abandoned his design for a freestanding house with courtyards. To his unfinished wing she added a pavilion that extended the building towards the river. This was built in a less experimental style by ", "Jean Bullant", ".

Drawings by ", "Jacques Androuet du Cerceau", " in the ", "British Museum", " may shed light on Catherine's intentions for Saint-Maur. They show a plan to enlarge each wing by doubling the size of the ", "pavilions", " next to the main block of the house.

That meant the extensions would not unbalance the masses of the building as seen from the side.", "[52]", "\n", "De l'Orme died in 1570; in 1575 an unknown architect took over at Saint-Maur.", "[67]", " The new man proposed to heighten the pavilions on the garden side and top them with pitched roofs.
